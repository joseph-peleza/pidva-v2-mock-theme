It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source."},{image:"https://via.placeholder.com/500x330",title:"Traditional Saunas",description:'Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.

The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English."},{image:"https://via.placeholder.com/500x330",title:"Infrared Saunas",description:"Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their CRM model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
